# WooWMS UI Redesign — macOS Sonoma Style

## Design Direction
Apple macOS Sonoma-inspired: clean, spacious, translucent sidebar, refined typography, lots of white space.

## Sidebar
- Collapsible — full labels that collapse to icon-only with smooth CSS transition
- Frosted glass feel — subtle muted background with soft border
- Active state — soft blue pill highlight (like macOS sidebar selection)
- Grouped nav sections: Main, Warehouse, Logistics, bottom Settings/Logout
- Collapse toggle button at bottom
- User/store info at top

## All Pages — Unified shadcn Design
- Page header with title + description + action buttons
- Cards with rounded-xl, subtle shadow, hover lift
- Clean tables with row hover, status badges as colored pills
- Modern form inputs with focus rings
- Consistent status color system: green/amber/blue/red

## Pages to Redesign
1. Layout/Sidebar (collapsible, grouped nav)
2. Orders (table with filters, status badges)
3. Inventory (table with stock levels, search)
4. Warehouse (zone cards, bin management)
5. Picking (pick list cards, items table)
6. Shipping (shipment table, carrier info)
7. Receiving (PO table, expected dates)
8. Settings (modern form cards)
