# Changelog

All notable changes to PickNPack will be documented in this file.
Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [3.25.2 / 2.23.2] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **Bundle "Available" shows Can Build in inventory list** — bundle products now show the number of bundles that can be built from component stock instead of always showing 0. Backend calculates `_canBuild` and includes it in the list API response
- **Bundle badge in inventory list** — bundle products show a violet "BUNDLE" badge next to the product name
- **Bundle stock bar uses violet color** — distinguishes bundle availability from regular stock at a glance

## [3.25.1 / 2.23.1] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **Backend blocks non-storage zone creation** — the auto-zone API endpoint now rejects dock_door, packing_table, receiving_area, shipping_area, staging_area. Only shelf, pallet_rack, pallet_storage can create zones. This is a hard block at the API level so zones can never be created for non-storage elements regardless of frontend state
- **Manual zone creation also guarded** — the "Create Zone" button in floor plan element properties now checks `hasZone` before calling the API

## [3.25.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Product search in PO creation** — added ProductSearchDropdown to PO create page so you can search for products by name/SKU instead of typing manually
- **Prefill PO from product page** — clicking "Create PO" on a product detail page now prefills the first line item with that product's SKU and name
- **Supplier SKU management from product detail** — can now add and delete supplier SKU mappings directly from the product detail page (Overview tab, Supplier SKUs card)

### Changed
- **Bundle stat cards show own stock** — bundle products now show 4 cards: "Can Build" (from components), "In Stock" (own assembled stock), "Reserved", "Components". Previously hid the product's own stock which made it look like stock disappeared

## [3.24.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Bundle product display overhaul** — bundle products now have a completely different UI treatment:
  - Stat cards show "Can Build" (calculated from components), "Components" count, and "Reserved" instead of regular stock metrics
  - Violet "Bundle" badge displayed next to product name
  - Overview tab shows "Component Stock" breakdown with per-component availability, limiting factor highlighted in amber
  - Components are clickable to navigate to the component product
  - "Create PO" button hidden (can't PO a bundle)
  - "Purchase Orders" and "Stock History" tabs hidden for bundles
  - "Incoming Stock" section hidden for bundles

### Fixed
- **Bundle search dropdown no longer cut off** — dropdown auto-detects viewport space and opens upward when near the bottom of the page, so results are always fully visible and clickable
- **Bundle search returns more results** — increased from 8 to 15 results for better discoverability

## [3.23.2] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **Non-storage elements no longer create zones** — Packing Table, Receiving Area, Shipping Area, Dock Door, and Staging Area are now map-only elements on the floor plan. Only actual storage elements (Shelving Rack, Pallet Rack, Pallet Storage) create zones with bin locations

## [3.23.1] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **Zone modal shows racks only** — Add Element on the Zones tab now only shows Shelving Rack, Pallet Rack, and Pallet Storage. Non-storage elements (Packing Table, Dock Door, Receiving Area, Shipping Area, Staging Area) are placed from the Floor Plan tab only
- **Warehouse docs rewritten** — comprehensive step-by-step usage guide with links to /warehouse, covering hierarchy, rack setup, bin sizing, stock-to-bin flow, floor plan builder, label printing, editing, and typical workflow

## [3.23.0 / 2.23.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Bin sizing (S/M/L/XL)** — bins now have a size category (Small=25, Medium=50, Large=100, XLarge=200 capacity). Selectable when generating locations, creating zones, and editing individual bins
- **Product size categories** — products auto-classified as Small/Medium/Large/XLarge/Oversized based on WooCommerce dimensions (L×W×H volume). Also settable manually via product edit
- **Assign stock to bin** — `POST /inventory/:id/assign-bin` endpoint upserts stock into a specific bin location with soft capacity warnings
- **Transfer stock between bins** — `POST /inventory/:id/transfer` endpoint moves stock from one bin to another with validation and capacity warnings
- **Bin selection during PO receiving** — when receiving items, a "Put to Bin" dropdown lets you assign each line item to a specific bin location
- **Bin contents in edit panel** — editing a bin now shows a "Contents" section listing all products stored in that bin with quantities
- **Pickable/Sellable flags** — bins can be marked as pickable (available for pick lists) and sellable (inventory counts toward available stock)

### Fixed
- **Stock-to-bin pipeline** — receiving items now creates `StockLocation` records linking stock to physical bin locations. Previously stock was only tracked as a global number on the product with no bin association
- **StockMovement toBin field** — now stores the human-readable bin label instead of the numeric bin ID

### Changed
- **Capacity indicators** — bin grid cells and list view now show stock/capacity fractions with red highlighting when over capacity
- **Bin edit panel** — replaced plain capacity number input with bin size selector + capacity override, plus pickable/sellable/active checkboxes

## [3.22.0 / 2.22.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Professional label printing** — redesigned Print Labels modal with Code 128 barcodes (via bwip-js), zone-type color stripes, and a polished layout showing location code, zone name, warehouse name, and location breakdown
- **5 label size options** — Zebra 4×6" (shipping label), Zebra 2×1" (small shelf label), Sheet Small (30/page), Sheet Medium (10/page), Sheet Large (6/page). Zebra sizes use custom paper dimensions for direct thermal printing
- **Custom location prefix** — configurable prefix field (up to 5 chars, auto-uppercase) in both the Add Element modal and the Edit Element slide-over. Live preview shows what location codes will look like (e.g. "SHE-01-01"). Prefix is stored on the floor plan element and passed to the auto-zone API
- **Print All Labels** — button in warehouse header prints labels for all locations across all zones at once
- **Regenerate bins endpoint** — `POST /zones/:zoneId/regenerate-bins` deletes old empty bins and creates new ones when shelves/positions change

### Changed
- **Label size selector** — split into two sections: "Direct Print (Zebra)" and "Sheet Labels (Letter)" with clearer descriptions
- **Print modal header** — shows zone-type color accent bar and zone/warehouse name in subtitle
- **Shelf/position descriptions** — fields now show helper text: "Vertical levels (floor → top)" and "Horizontal slots (left → right)" everywhere they appear
- **Floor plan storage setup** — shelves/positions inputs now visible for linked zones too, not just unlinked elements
- **Edit element save** — changing shelves/positions now regenerates the actual bin locations in the database (was only saving config without updating bins)
- **Edit warning** — shows amber warning when shelf/position count differs from existing locations, explaining bins will be regenerated

## [3.21.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **Unified zone/element creation** — "Add Zone" replaced with "Add Element" modal that picks element type first (Shelving Rack, Pallet Rack, Packing Table, etc.), then configures label, shelves, and positions. Creates both zone + floor plan element in one step.
- **Click-to-edit element cards** — clicking a card opens the edit panel with rack config (name, shelves, positions per shelf). Hover shows Edit, Print, and Delete icons. No more confusing footer buttons.
- **Edit panel shows rack setup** — edit slide-over displays element type icon, name input, shelves (1-20), positions per shelf (1-20), and location count summary. Saves to both zone and floor plan element.
- **Zone cards show element type** — element summary cards display the element icon and type label (e.g. Shelving Rack, Pallet Storage) when linked to a floor plan element
- **Unplaced elements handled** — elements created from Zones tab (unplaced, x:-1/y:-1) are excluded from grid rendering and overlap checks; toolbar shows unplaced count

### Removed
- **Generate Bins button** — bins are now auto-created when elements are created, no separate generate step needed
- **View Locations / Floor Plan footer buttons** — replaced with click-to-edit on the whole card

## [3.20.0 / 2.21.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **Saving floor plan auto-creates zones** — clicking Save now automatically creates zones (with bins) for every element that doesn't have one yet. Place shelves, racks, tables → hit Save → zones appear in the Zones tab. No more clicking "Create Zone" on each element one by one.
- **Floor plan ↔ zones unified** — creating a zone from the floor plan now auto-saves the floor plan (persists the element↔zone link immediately) and switches to the Zones tab so the new zone is visible right away. The two tabs are now truly two views of the same data.
- **Element label on zone cards** — zone cards linked to a floor plan element show the element name (e.g. "Shelving Rack 1") with a grid icon, making the connection between both views visible

## [3.18.0 / 2.21.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **3 new floor plan elements** — Pallet Storage (green, 2×2, ground-level pallet positions), Dock Door (teal, 3×1, loading bay entry points), Staging Area (pink, 2×3, temp holding between pick/pack)
- **Grid scale legend** — bottom-left corner of the floor plan grid shows "= 1 m" or "= 1 ft" so users understand what one square represents
- Backend auto-zone mapping for new element types: pallet_storage→STORAGE, dock_door→RECEIVING, staging_area→PICKING

### Fixed
- **Slide-over page overflow** — opening a zone edit slide-over on the Warehouse Detail page no longer causes horizontal scroll; added `overflow-x-hidden` to main content wrapper

## [3.17.0 / 2.20.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Configurable storage setup** — when creating a zone from a floor plan element, configure shelves (1-20) and positions per shelf (1-20) instead of hardcoded 4×3; settings persist on the element and are shown as a summary before zone creation
- **Cross-tab zone ↔ floor plan navigation** — click "Floor Plan" on a zone card to jump to the Floor Plan tab with the linked element auto-selected; click "View" on a linked zone in the floor plan properties to jump back to the Zones tab filtered to that zone's type
- Zone stats (shelf count, total locations) shown in ElementProperties when a zone is linked

## [3.16.0 / 2.20.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Unit system for floor plans** — choose between feet (ft) and meters (m) when creating a floor plan; unit displayed in toolbar and property panel
- **Decimal element sizes** — elements can now have fractional dimensions (e.g., 1.3m wide rack) with 0.1 snap precision
- **Element duplication** — duplicate any selected element via "Duplicate" button or **Ctrl/Cmd+D** keyboard shortcut
- **Auto-collapse sidebar** — sidebar automatically collapses when viewing the Floor Plan tab for more editing space, restores on tab change

### Changed
- Floor plan grid now uses AABB overlap detection instead of integer occupancy grid, enabling precise decimal positioning
- Setup form uses `parseFloat` with `step="0.1"` for decimal warehouse dimensions
- Backend floor plan validation now accepts decimal width/height with `isFinite()` checks

### Removed
- **Aisle element type** — removed from the element palette; free space on the grid represents aisles naturally. Existing aisle elements are auto-filtered on load.

## [3.15.0 / 2.19.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Visual Floor Plan Builder** — new "Floor Plan" tab on the Warehouse Detail page with a 2D grid editor for designing warehouse layouts. Set warehouse dimensions in meters, then place elements (shelving racks, pallet racks, packing tables, receiving/shipping areas, aisles, walls) on a visual grid.
- **Floor plan element palette** — 7 element types with color-coded icons, default sizes, and drag-to-place interaction
- **Element properties panel** — edit label, resize, rotate (0/90°), link to existing zones, or auto-create new zones with bins
- **Auto-zone creation** — `POST /api/v1/warehouse/:id/floor-plan/auto-zone` creates a zone + optional bins from a floor plan element, mapping element types to zone types (shelf→STORAGE, packing_table→PACKING, etc.)
- **Floor plan persistence** — `PUT /api/v1/warehouse/:id/floor-plan` saves the complete floor plan (dimensions + elements) as JSONB
- **Floor plan schema** — `floor_plan` JSONB column on warehouses table (migration `20260301200000_warehouse_floor_plan`)
- Drag-to-move elements on the grid with collision detection
- Undo history (up to 20 steps) for floor plan edits

### Changed
- Warehouse Detail page now has a **Zones / Floor Plan** tab toggle — Zones tab shows the existing zone cards view (unchanged), Floor Plan tab shows the visual editor

## [3.14.0 / 2.18.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Sync progress bar** — product sync now shows real-time progress percentage with animated bar; sync runs in background so the modal can be closed while sync continues

- **Sync status polling endpoint** — `GET /api/v1/inventory/sync-status/:jobId` for tracking background sync progress
- **Docs site favicon** — PickNPack favicon added to docs site

### Changed
- **Help link** — sidebar Help button now opens `docs.picknpack.io` in a new tab instead of the in-app help center

- **Sync endpoint** — `POST /api/v1/inventory/sync` now returns a `jobId` immediately and runs sync in background

## [3.13.0 / 2.17.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **WooCommerce product variations support** — Variable products are now expanded into individual variations during sync (e.g., "T-Shirt - Large / Red"), each with its own SKU, price, stock quantity, and image. Parent "variable" products are skipped since they aren't sellable items.
- **Variation schema fields** — `product_type` (simple/variation), `woo_parent_id` (WooCommerce parent ID for grouping), `variant_attributes` (JSON of attribute name/value pairs like `{"Size": "Large", "Color": "Red"}`)
- **Variation-aware stock push** — Push stock and product edits to WooCommerce now uses the correct variation API endpoint (`products/{parent}/variations/{id}`) for variation products
- **Documentation site** (`docs-site/`) — Public docs at `docs.picknpack.io` built with React + Vite + Tailwind, featuring clean editorial design with sidebar navigation and 11 documentation pages covering all modules
- **CLAUDE.md docs rule** — New mandatory rule to keep documentation in sync with feature changes
- Database migration `20260301180000_product_variations`

### Changed

## [3.2.1] - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- **Login & Register redesigned** with light background + flowing gradient ribbon shapes — vibrant blue, coral/pink, indigo, and warm accent bands sweep across a clean `#f6f9fc` background
- Clean white card with subtle shadow, no glass/blur/dark effects — form is dead simple with dark text on white, standard gray-bordered inputs
- Logo sits top-left of page, card centered vertically, footer at bottom
- Inputs use standard light styling: white background, `#d1d5db` border, `#111827` text, blue focus ring

- All glass-morphism, backdrop-filter, dark background styling from auth pages

## [3.0.1] - 2026-02-28

- **Logo** replaced placeholder black "P" square with actual PickNPack SVG wordmark logo in all 4 locations (sidebar, login, register, connect store)
- Sidebar shows full wordmark when expanded, compact "p+Q" logomark when collapsed

- **WarehouseDetail** — per-warehouse page showing all zones with full-width stacked utilization bar colored by zone type, segmented zone type filter pills, zone summary cards with stats and action footers (View Locations, Generate, Print)
- **ZoneDetail** — per-zone page with bin-level detail: 4 stat pills, real-time search input, aisle/status dropdown filters, grid/list view toggle, collapsible aisle sections with rack limit (show 5 racks initially, expand on click), inline add location form (replaces `window.prompt()`)
- **Slide-over panels** replace centered modals for editing warehouses, zones, and bins (right-anchored 420px panel with backdrop and Escape-to-close)
- **BinGrid refactored** — aisles are now collapsible sections with expand/collapse toggle, multi-rack aisles show each rack separately with "Show N more" overflow
- **BinListView** — new sortable data table view for bins with columns (Label, Aisle, Shelf, Position, Stock, Status), 25-per-page pagination, ideal for 500+ locations

- **"Help" link in sidebar** — Question icon link above Settings in the sidebar footer, navigating to `/docs`

- "Print Labels" button in zone header (visible when zone has locations)
- "All Help Topics" button in warehouse page bottom banner linking to `/docs`

### Fixed

## [2.7.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Warehouse Setup Guide** page (`/warehouse/guide`) — visual documentation explaining the full warehouse hierarchy (Zone → Aisle → Rack → Shelf → Position) with real-world analogies (library/grocery store), color-coded label breakdown, interactive rack diagram, zone type explanations with examples, 3-step quick start, and a complete small e-commerce warehouse example (268 locations)

## [2.7.0] - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- **Real WMS location hierarchy** — warehouse locations now follow the ShipHero-inspired `Aisle-Rack-Shelf-Position` naming convention (e.g. `A-01-03-02` = Aisle A, Rack 01, Shelf 03, Position 02)
- **Location Generator Wizard** — completely rewritten with 4 inputs (aisles, racks per aisle, shelf levels, positions per shelf), Letters/Numbers toggle for aisle naming, live mini rack diagram preview, color-coded label format explainer, and total location count summary
- **Vertical Rack Visualization** — bins grouped by aisle and displayed as visual rack units (top shelf → floor), with shelf level labels on the left and position cells across each shelf; ungrouped locations shown separately
- **Zone sections** — now show left-colored accent border matching zone type, location/aisle/item counts, "Generate Locations" button highlighted when zone is empty
- Terminology updated from "bins" to "locations" throughout (BinModal, ZoneSection, WarehouseCard, page header)
